# Anti-Spam for decidim

Flexible detection and reaction on spam for Decidim, sponsored by:

* [Participer Lausanne](https://participer.lausanne.ch)
* [Genève Participe](https://participer.ge.ch)

## Available Detection
This anti-spam gem comes with three core detection for spam: 

* Allowed TLDs: A list of all extensions (like `.com`) that are allowed. If an extension not present in the list is detected, a `Not Allowed Tlds Found` is raised
* Forbidden TLDs: A list of all extensions (like `.finance`) that are forbidden. If an extension not present in the list is detected, a `Forbidden Tlds Found` is raised
* Words: A dictionnary of forbidden word. If a forbidden word is found, a `Word Found` is raised.

## Rules
A rule is a link between the detection and what you do with the user (the agent).
We work on two sets of rules: SPAM and SUSPICIOUS. You can this way define two kinds of actions and have a more fine-grained spam policy.  For example, you could: 

* When a `.xxx` domain is found, Lock the user
* When a domain that is not `.com, .ch, .eu, .io`, Signalize the user to the admins.

## Agent
An agent is activated by a rule with a detected content. We have for now two agent: 

1. Lock: Use the `Devise::Lockable` strategy to lock the user, and send unlock instructions by email
2. Sinalize: Do nothing, but sinalize the user to the admins

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "decidim-spam_signal", git: "https://github.com/octree-gva/decidim-module-spam_signal"
```

Then execute:

```bash
bundle
bundle exec rails decidim_spam_signal:install:migrations
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

## Environment Variable

```bash
export USER_BOT_EMAIL='bot@example.ch' # user-bot used for signaling the spammers
export ANTISPAM_ADMIN='admin@example.ch' # if only one email should receive notifications from the anti-spam
```

## Scripting
We don't have UI for this (and probably won't), so here some useful script: 

Who is locked for more than a month and didn't unlock their account (CSV)?
```ruby
require "csv"
headers=["id", "nickname", "email", "vérouillé le"]
CSV.open("locked-users.csv", "w") do |csv|
  csv << headers
  Decidim::User.where("locked_at < ?", 31.days.ago).pluck(:id, :nickname, :email, :locked_at).each {|usr| csv << usr }
end
```


Apply your spam strategy to existing data?
```ruby
Decidim::User.all.each {|user| user.valid? }
Decidim::Comments::Comment.all.each {|comment| comment.valid? }
```

# Add your own detection 
An agent have two classes: A command class, and a form class (for settings). 

For `Command`, here some restrictions:

* You need to define a form to a `Decidim::Form` class, with absolute `::<name>` namespace. You will have trouble with memory allocation if you don't
* You need to suffix your command with `ScanCommand` name. That's a convention we use to avoid configurations.
* call must broadcast :ok or one of the `output_symbols` defined 

```ruby
class CustomScanCommand < Decidim::SpamSignal::Scans::ScanHandler
    def self.form
        ::CustomSettingsForm
    end
    def self.output_symbols
        [:foo]
    end
    def call
        return broadcast(:foo) if config["foo_enabled"]
        broadcast(:ok)
    end
end
```


For Settings: 

* You need to include the module `Decidim::SpamSignal::SettingsForm` to make the whole thing work
* We have special naming rules on how you name your attributes:
    * if its start with `is_` or end with `_enabled`, you will have a checkbox
    * if its ends with `_csv` you will have a textarea
    * the rest is like default decidim's form builder.

```ruby
class CustomSettingsForm < Decidim::Form
    include Decidim::SpamSignal::SettingsForm
    attribute :foo_enabled, Boolean, default: false
    # You can add validation here ;)
end
```

And now, you can register your command in an initializer: 
```ruby
Decidim::SpamSignal::Scans::ScansRepository.instance.register(:custom, ::CustomScanCommand)
```

And set the i18n fields: 
* `decidim.spam_signal.scans.custom.name`
* `decidim.spam_signal.scans.custom.description`
* `decidim.spam_signal.forms.custom.custom_settings_form.foo_enabled`


# Add your own agent
We won't advise you create your own agent, as it seems the Lock agent as the strongest agent is already a good compromise for spam control. If you really want it, that's simple, it's almost like detection:

* Use `CopCommand` to suffix your command
* Add a `self.form` to your settings (it can returns `nil`)
* Use these different attributes: 
    * `suspicious_user` the user that have done something wrong
    * `admin_reporter` an admin user only used to report spam
    * `errors` an ActiveRecord error, to forbid saving (@see [Working With Validation Errors in Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#working-with-validation-errors))

```ruby
class CustomCopCommand < Decidim::SpamSignal::Cops::CopHandler
    def self.form
        ::CustomSettingsForm
    end

    def call
        suspicious_user.lock_access! # or do whatever with the admin
    end
end
```

Settings are exactly the same logic, and i18n fields: 
* `decidim.spam_signal.cops.custom.name`
* `decidim.spam_signal.cops.custom.description`
* `decidim.spam_signal.forms.custom.custom_settings_form.foo_enabled`

To register it in an initializer:
```ruby
Decidim::SpamSignal::Cops::CopsRepository.instance.register(:custom, ::CustomCopCommand)
```


**N.B** You will find in the code the term `cop` to refer an agent. 
This is provocative on purpose: participation must be as inclusive as possible, restricting participation is _BAD_. You are warned, be your own cop.
