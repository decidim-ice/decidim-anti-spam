              <p>
                Welcome to your spam prevention panel. <br />
                You will be able to control spam on the following situations:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>When a user edit his profile</li>
                <li>When a user post a new comment</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>How does it work?</h3>
              <p>The process is simple: extract content to verifies, scan it, and react from spam detection.<br />
              Spam Scanning have three possible results:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>ok</strong>: All good, the user can proceed</li>
                <li><strong>suspicious</strong>: We don't know if it's a spam, but it looks like one</li>
                <li><strong>spam</strong>: Almost sure it's a spam</li>
              </ol>

              For the <code>suspicious</code> and <code>spam</code> results, a <strong>cop</strong> is called.
              This cop will do some actions, like creating an error, signaling or block the user and its content.

              <h3>Lock Cop</h3>
              The lock cop will lock the user for 15minutes, and send unlock instructions by emails.
              It will also signalise the content the user have posted, to be sure admin review them.
              <ol>
                <li>The user get disconnected</li>
                <li>The user receive unlock instructions by email</li>
                <li>User's content is signaled to admins</li>
              </ol>
